Tensile properties of several N95 mask band materials were evaluated after 5 and 10 sterilization 
cycles with vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ethylene oxide gas, and compared to control specimens.
Initial results suggest sterilization may cause some physical changes to the mask band materials, 
but that these changes are unlikely to result in band rupture or other catastrophic failure under 
normal use conditions.
